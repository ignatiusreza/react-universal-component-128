    <p>Aegaeon, the bodyguard of kings. He’s a Water TNK blade and he uses a chrome katana in battle. He is originally the Emperor’s blade, but for plot reasons, becomes entrusted to us. He’s Kozaki’s second and last blade design, and does anyone else notice any similarities to his Awakening work?. His name may also be a reference to greek mythology; Aegaeon is one of the Hecantioniers, or he may be a reference to the Aegean Sea since he’s a water blade. Anyways, he’s pretty cool and it’s hinted that he and Brighid have something going on. Other than Brighid, his favorites are Fondant Rice Cake and Montecoran Doll, and he likes desserts and art.</p>

    <p>To get Aegaeon, he is obtained through the main story at the end of Chapter 6. I know these discussions aren’t made for “story blades”, but technically, Aegaeon is grouped with the other non-story blades on the wiki and you’re not forced to open his core crystal like you had to with Roc. He’s also the first non-randomized core crystal blade we’ll discuss.</p>

    <h2>Blade Specials</h2>

    <dl>
      <dt>Water Moon</dt>
      <dd>Adds at least 60% of dealing a guard-annulling attack, which is a very good thing for tanks. It’s easy to rank up as well, just do blade combos.</dd>

      <dt>Breaking Wave</dt>
      <dd>Increases critical damage by at least 25%, so this can be useful for any crit heal builds. The only monster it wants you to kill is the Fresh Rodonyas in Tantal for tier 2. Luckily, his core should be awakened around the time you’re in Tantal. The rest of the tiers is by performing this special and driver combos.</dd>

      <dt>Midnight Mist</dt>
      <dd>Increases damage dealt to enemies by at least 60%. Couple with Breaking Wave, Aegaeon becomes a very offense-oriented TNK. Using it and driver combos levels it up its tiers. So all in all, it’s not difficult to complete.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h2>Battle Skills</h2>

    <dl>
      <dt>Serene Heart</dt>
      <dd>Increases evasion at max affinity for at least 10 seconds. To increase its rank, raising affinity unlocks the second and last tier. However, the middle two tiers require you to raise the dev level in Mor Ardain and view his Heart-2-Heart.</dd>

      <dt>Like Water</dt>
      <dd>Improves evasion by at least 20% while moving. This is leveled up by simply evading attacks. It becomes easier to level this up the higher tier you go.</dd>

      <dt>Enlightenment</dt>
      <dd>Improves evasion by at least 20% when HP is below 30%. This is leveled up by blocking. So if you evade or if you block, you’re leveling up at least one defensive skill. May become harder to tier up when his evasion gets really high.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h3>Blade Arts</h3>
    <p>He has Accuracy Up and Nullify Reaction. Like the name suggest, Accuracy Up increases his accuracy. It’s a nice art, but since he’s a TNK, doing damage isn’t his main priority anyways. However, Nullify Reaction is a great blade art for TNKs because they’re defense-oriented, and this art gives enemies a harder time getting the upper hand on the team punching bag.</p>

    <h3>Field Skills</h3>
    <p>Aegaeon’s 3 blade skills are Water Mastery, Ancient Wisdom, and Leaping. Unlike most rare blades, he has no exclusive field skill, which I think it’s kind of nice, because the exclusive skills can get so niche that they’re not used outside of their quests, so this is very helpful. Water Mastery is needed in plenty of merc missions and quite a few field checks, so I consider it very useful. Ancient Wisdom is also nice to have, as there’s also a few field checks and merc missions that want this skill. Leaping is also nice to have. All in all, I love his field skills. He’s good for that reason alone.</p>

    <h3>Aux Cores</h3>
    <p>He starts out with 2 slots. Since he capitalizes on evasion, giving him evasion cores would be best. If you don’t have any of those, I’d give him more defensive cores so he’ll at least level up his blocking.</p>

    <h3>Compatible Drivers</h3>
    <p>He can only be used by Morag at first, and to be honest, you don’t really want him on anyone else. He’s made for Morag- she’s a dodge tank and his best attribute is his high evasion. You could also use him with Rex, and he’s pretty decent with Rex. Not as good as with Morag, but can get the job done. Morag has smash and Rex has break with him. I wouldn’t recommend him for the other 2, since they have no driver combos with Chrome Katana and there’s better water blades for them to use.</p>
