    <p>Adenine, the intellectual. She’s a Wind HLR blade and she uses her knuckles in battle. She has a cool belt and paper effect with her design. I love how she looks like she’s constantly floating as well. Her name refers to some sort of biochemistry regarding DNA, but I ain’t a science major so the words to explain it are going over my head. Anyways, she loves veggies and literature, with her favorites being Torigoth Marinade and Leftherian Life.</p>

    <p>She can be obtained through opening a random core crystal. She could technically be the first core you ever open (the one you get from Azurda) or so I’ve heard.</p>

    <p>A special thing about her is that after you complete her quest, you can find her in the Data Processing Room in the World Tree if she’s not engaged instead of Garfront.</p>

    <h2>Blade Specials</h2>

    <dl>
      <dt>Harness the Wind</dt>
      <dd>Reduces aggro by at least 20%. This is particularly useful for HLRs, as you don’t want them to get focused on and hit.</dd>

      <dt>Slipstream</dt>
      <dd>Increases the chances of making a guard-annulling attack by at least 60%. Just like Aegeon from yesterday.</dd>

      <dt>Mortal Storm</dt>
      <dd>Has the same effect as Slipstream. Adenine’s effects seem to be more defense-oriented, which can make her a silent killer of sorts. Although they seem cool in theory, in my experience, Knuckles blades never had a problem of attracting too much aggro, especially if my resident tank has the proper accessories and cores.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h3>Blade Arts</h3>
    <p>She has Accuracy Up and Debuff Cancel. Like their names suggests, Adenine will have high accuracy and will usually hit her target. She also has a chance to remove a negative status effect from taking place.</p>

    <h2>Battle Skills</h2>

    <dl>
      <dt>Element Wisdom</dt>
      <dd>Increases blade combo damage by at least 20%. This makes her great in blade combos, especially since wind is in quite a few different combos. As you may have guessed, this is leveled up by simply having her participate in blade combos.</dd>

      <dt>Battle Wisdom</dt>
      <dd>Increases damage dealt if elemental weakness is exploited. There’s no given percentage by how much in-game, but it affects the entire party, so it’s a pretty good effect IMO. It’s leveled up by performing driver combos. Adenine doesn’t need to participate in them, she just needs to be present.</dd>

      <dt>Treasure Wisdom</dt>
      <dd>Increases the item drop rate by at least 60%. It’s a great skill for collecting random doodads and such. It’s the easiest to level up, all Adenine has to do is engage in combat. The last tier is simply use two books.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h3>Field Skills</h3>
    <p>Her field skills are Wind Mastery, Keen Eye, and Extra-Ancient Wisdom. Wind Mastery has its niche: it’s great for merc missions and the field checks that require one to go leaping about the place. Keen Eye is also useful for field checks related to old text and ruins, as well for merc missions. Extra-Ancient Wisdom, not so much. Outside her quest, there’s not much of a use for it. It’s always so frustrating to see an Ancient Wisdom proc and know that there’s nothing that Adenine can do for it. I wish they took out the “Extra”. It’s extra.</p>

    <h3>Aux Cores</h3>
    <p>Like most blades, she has 2. There’s no aux core in particular that’s a must have for Adenine, but if there’s a core that boosts drop rates of items available, then I would put that on her to capitalize on Treasure Wisdom. You may also want to some damage boosters if you want her (or any Knuckles for that matter) to take on a more combative role than a support role.</p>

    <h3>Compatible Drivers</h3>
    <p>The beauty about Knuckles blades is that they’re pretty good with every driver. They have a fast moveset, so while their individual attacks don’t do much, the damage can stack up pretty quickly. Rex doesn’t get a driver combo with any Knuckles, but he’s still pretty useful with them due to his high physical attack. Nia is also a good with Knuckles, and it’s her only moveset which gives her launch. Morag gets break and Zeke gets topple. If I had to pick a driver to put her on, I would say Zeke, mainly because Rex already has Roc, and there’s other wind blades more suited for Nia and Morag’s niches.</p>
