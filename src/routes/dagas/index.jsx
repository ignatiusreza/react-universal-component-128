    <p>Dagas, the Kaiser of all Blades, or so he says. He is a Fire ATK blade and uses a greataxe in battle. He’s a self-proclaimed king, and firmly believes it. My personal headcanon is that he was once a greedy king and human, but was cursed to serve as a blade for eternity due to his vice of pride. His memory of being king sticks with him to torment him. Maybe his kingdom was one the ones that Mythra had allegedly sank to the Cloud Sea? Enough with theories for now, he was drawn by hakus, who also designed Azami. Other than being a Kaiser, his favorite things are Aromalocaris Saute and Black Flower Field, and he enjoys seafood and art from time to time.</p>

    <p>He can be obtained by opening up a random core crystal.</p>

    <h2>Blade Specials</h2>

    <dl>
      <dt>Flame Crown</dt>
      <dd>Increases damage to aquatic elemental enemies by at least 60%. This is pretty useful in areas where aquatic enemies are abundant, although not much anywhere else. The second and last tier are increased by simply using this special, and tier 3 wants 15 driver combos, which shouldn’t be too hard with anyone other than Morag. Tier 4 requires you to defeat the Hool Arachno in Tantal.</dd>

      <dt>Tyrant Crush</dt>
      <dd>This increases critical damage by at least 25%, so when Dagas crits, he hits hard. Giving him critical boosting items is a good idea. The second and third tiers can be unlocked by defeating prom piranhax in Uraya and 5 insect creatures in Lefteria.</dd>

      <dt>Kaiser Flare</dt>
      <dd>This increases damage by 100% when health is below 30%. Strange how both of hakus’ blades both have this effect… Anyways to level this up, perform driver combos for the second tier, and use the special for the 3rd and last tiers. As for the fourth, defeating insect creatures in Tantal does the trick. The Hool Arachno needed for Flame Crown can be used for this as well, so it’s hitting two birds with one stone.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h3>Blade Arts</h3>
    <p>He has Arts Plus and Critical Up. Arts Plus raises the power of Dagas’ next art, which can be nice damage bonus. Critical Up, like the name implies, increases his critical rate.</p>

    <h2>Battle Skills</h2>

    <dl>
      <dt>Kaiser Zone</dt>
      <dd>This increases damage output and AOE of attacks by at least 40% at max affinity. This affects the whole party, and it can become very powerful once leveled Your whole party can hit hard with the skill. It’s not complicated to level up, just raise affinity.</dd>

      <dt>Regal Presence</dt>
      <dd>This increases blade combo damage by at least 10%. Coupled with Arts Plus, Dagas will be able to do some nice damage during blade combos. Oddly enough, this is raised by collecting insects.</dd>

      <dt>Gold Effect</dt>
      <dd>This increases the gold drop rate during battle by at least 30%. This can be useful for a certain water blade we’ll discuss later, and honestly, they work well together. Plus they interact with each other after battle as well. This can be done by raising money, which isn’t so hard to do once you start salvaging.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h3>Field Skills</h3>
    <p>He initially only has 1 field skill, Cavalier attitude, which is exclusive to him. There’s not many (if any) opportunities to use this, so it’s kind of useless outside his blade quest. It’s fitting for a characterization standpoint, because he doesn’t like the party when he joins. However, he gains not 1, not 2, but 3 field skills after you finish his blade quest. Cavalier Attitude gets replaced (IIRC). He gains Nopon Wisdom (kind of strange tbh), Ancient Wisdom, and Mineralogy. Nopon Wisdom is useful for quite of few blade checks, if you manage to get this skill before you’ve done them with Poppi and some other blade. Ancient Wisdom has its uses in both field checks and merc missions, so it’s a great skill. Mineralogy is very useful for foraging and for a small amount of merc missions, but if you need to gather rocks for a quest or materials, this will help streamline it. I believe he’s the only person with 4 field skills.</p>

    <h3>Aux Cores</h3>
    <p>He initially only has 1 aux core. But guess what, that can be changed! Once you complete his blade quest, he gains 2 more leading to a whopping 3 slots! How awesome is that? As for cores, since he’s an ATK blade, why not emphasize his offensive potential. I would put some cores that add damage and maybe a core that increases affinity. Cores that raise critical damage would also be a good choice.</p>

    <h3>Compatible Drivers</h3>
    <p>As a fire ATK blade, his main comparison will be Pyra. Because of this, this will rule out Rex in the early game. If you’re more of a Mythra user, than Dagas works well with Rex. He has launch with greataxes, so Dagas compliments Mythra well. Nia is also great with Dagas, as there’s no fire HLRs and the only other fire blade she can obtain is a TNK, so Dagas has no competition for Nia. He’s also decent with Morag. Although she has no driver combo with him and he has competition with Brighid, I feel like they compliment each other personality-wise. His grandiose behavior can be grounded by Morag’s stern attitude, plus she grew up in an environment where she may have dealt with those types of people. But, I would have to say his best driver is Zeke. Like Nia, Zeke only has 2 fire blades to choose from, and he’s better with a greataxe than a chrome katana. Zeke will have topple with Dagas, and since Zeke has high ATK potential, they can be a wonderful pair. Plus, I also think they work personality-wise.</p>
